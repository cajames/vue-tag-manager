# Vue Tag Manager

> Simple Google Tag Manager implementation for Vue

## Why need another one?

Initially used VueGTM, but wanted to be able to dynamically configure the injected ID + initial DataLayer.

Really liked the React GTM initialisation experience, but liked the Vue GTM dev and track experience (as a Vue Plugin). So I combined both of them into this simple library.

## TODO

- [ ] Initital implementation from React GTM
- [ ] Vue Plugin
- [ ] Regex page view matcher
