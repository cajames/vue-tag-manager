# Vue Tag Manager

> Simple Google Tag Manager implementation for Vue

## Why need another GTM library?

Initially used [vue-gtm](https://github.com/mib200/vue-gtm) which is a great library, but wanted to be able to programatically configure the GTMID and initial DataLayer.

Really liked the [React GTM](https://github.com/alinemorelli/react-gtm) script injection dev experience, and liked the Vue GTM dev and track experience (as a Vue Plugin, with the `$gtm` interface). So this plugin aims to combine both of them into this simple library.

## TODO

- [x] Initital implementation from React GTM
- [x] Vue Plugin
- [ ] Regex page view matcher
